\subsection*{Run-time Analysis}
Algorithm 1: $\Theta(n^3)$ \\
Algorithm 1 uses a triple nested for loop and doesn't do anything to break the loop. \\
\\
Algorithm 2: $\Theta(n^3)$ \\
Algorithm 2 is simply the same implementation as Algorithm 1 with a small check 
to bring the run-time down a little bit. \\
\\
Algorithm 3: $\Theta(n)$ \\
Algorithm 3 only loops over the lines once. Although we have the recursive 
filter_visible function, which only runs over visible lines, the number of 
times the function recursively calls itself does not depend on the number of 
given lines. \\

\subsubsection*{Asymptotic Analysis}

All three algorithms are $\theta(n)$ to each other. While each algorithm is more efficient than the last, they all iterate through the set of lines at a linear rate. 

\subsection*{Correctness of Claim 2/Algorithm 3}

\begin{theorem}
  If \emph{$\{y_{j1},y_{j2},...,y_{jt}\}$} is the visible subset of \emph{$\{y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{i-1}\}$} where \emph{$(t \leq i-1)$} then $\{y_{j1},y_{j2},...,y_{jk},y_{i}\}$ is the visible subset of $\{y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{i}\}$ where $y_{jk}$ is the last line such that $y_{jk}(x^{*}) \geq y_{i}(x^{*})$ where $(x^{*},y_{jk}(x^{*}))$ is the point of intersection of the lines $y_{jk}$ and $y_{jk-1}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose there exists a set of intersecting lines $A$ and that the slope of each line is unique. Further suppose that a subset of those lines $V$ are the only lines in $A$ that are visible when viewed from above. Now, if a new line is appended to $V$, a subset $V_{1}$ is created within $V$ that consists of the original lines within $V$.\newline
$V$ contains lines $\{y_{j1},\ldots,y_{jt}\}$
\newline
$A$ contains lines $\{y_{1},\ldots,y_{i-1}\}$\newline
Let $y_{i}$ be the line added to $V$ and let $y_{jk}$ be the last line in the set that has an intersection point with the line before it that is greater than the intersection point between itself and the new line (symbolically explained previously).\newline
In order for a line to be visible, it must have at least one point on it whose x value is greater than the point of intersection between it and the next closest line (Equation 1 on the Visible Lines Handout). Therefore, any new line added to $V$ that is visible must have at least one visible point on it that is greater than the point of intersection between itself and the next closest visible line ($y_{jk}$). If there exists a visible line already in $V$ whose point of intersection between itself and $y_{jk}$ has a greater $x$ value than the $x$ value of the point of intersection with the new line and $y_{jk}$ then this line is no longer visible. However, all visible lines with x-intersect values less than that of the new line will remain visible and thus form a subset $V_{1}$ within $V$.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Extrapolation and Interpolation}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{The biggest instances that could be solved within one hour were not able to be determined.}
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item Algorithm 1 (blue) slope is $\frac{\log(48.599125/8.711271)}{\log(700/400)} = 3.072$
\item Algorithm 2 (red) slope is $\frac{\log(5.17444/.965603}{700/400} = 2.99$
\item Algorithm 3 (green) slope is $\frac{\log(.00106699999999/.000685000000001}{700/400} = .792$
\end{enumerate}
It appears that Algorithms 1 and 2 are similar enough to each other to be $\theta$ to each other, but Algorithm 3 increases at such a lower rate that it is closer to $O$ for both 1 and 2.
\end{enumerate}
